# ML_Classification

I provided with a list of clients. For each client, I was given with their height, salary,
and whether this client made a purchase.The task was to implement a set of classifiers, to predict
if a future client will make a purchase.

For the prediction, i trained the following
models:
• K-nn (based on Euclidian distance)
• Logistic regression
• Support Vector Classifier
  o Linear SVC
  o Polynomial SVC of degree m (m will be set in the code)
  o Gaussian SVC
